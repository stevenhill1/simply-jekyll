I am currently living and working at home in North Wiltshire.

In my role as Director of Research for [Research England](https://re.ukri.org/), I am focussing on:

* planning for the evaluation of [REF 2021](http://ref.ac.uk) and starting work on thinking about the next national research assessment.
* the implications of the [Spending Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-2020-documents/spending-review-2020) for Research England's funding for next year.
* planning contributions to the Third Mission Panel for the Italian national research assessment, the VQR. I am presenting on the experience of assessing impact in the REF.

I am thinking about, researching, or drafting articles on:

* planning some longer essays on the assessment of research impact.

I am currently reading:

* [Why Iâ€™m No Longer Talking to White People About Race](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Longer-Talking-White-People-About-ebook/dp/B06WWPX2YF/) by Reni Eddo-Lodge
* [The Dark Forest](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dark-Forest-Three-Body-Problem-Book-ebook/dp/B00U7G0UYI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1604514921&sr=8-3-spons) by Cixin Liu

I am currently living and working at home in North Wiltshire.

In my role as Director of Research for [Research England](https://re.ukri.org/), I am focussing on:

* how to allocate additional funding streams (for specialist institutions, announced in [Budget 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents/budget-2020), and capital funding, [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-fires-up-rd-across-the-country-to-cement-the-uk-as-science-superpower) on 1 July 2020)
* working on Research England's contributions to the [Spending Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-launches-comprehensive-spending-review)
* preparing for a meeting of the [UKRI Infrastructure Advisory Committee](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/ukri-infrastructure-advisory-committee/)


I am thinking about, researching, or drafting articles on:

* alternatives to peer review for the allocation of research funding (mentioned in a [previous post](https://stevenhill.org.uk/a-post-pandemic-research-agenda/))
* the implications of applying the ideas of systems thinking to the research system (also mentioned in a [the same post](https://stevenhill.org.uk/a-post-pandemic-research-agenda/))
* updating the ideas in my post on ['Four trends shaping the future of research evaluation'](https://stevenhill.org.uk/four-trends-shaping-the-future-of-research-evaluation/) in the light of the pandemic
* the role of 'realist' approach to evaluation in research policy
* writing a review of [Mass Appeal](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mass-appeal-9780190062187?cc=gb&lang=en&) by Justin Gest, for the [LSE Review of Books](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/).

I am currently reading:

* [The Innovation Deulsion: How Our Obsession with the New Has Disrupted the Work That Matters Most](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Innovation-Deulsion-Lee-Vinsel/dp/0525575685/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1604514807&sr=8-1) by Lee Vinsel and Andrew Russell
* [The Dark Forest](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dark-Forest-Three-Body-Problem-Book-ebook/dp/B00U7G0UYI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1604514921&sr=8-3-spons) by Cixin Liu

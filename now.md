I am currently living and working at home in North Wiltshire.

In my role as Director of Research for [Research England](https://re.ukri.org/), I am focussing on:

* how to allocate additional funding streams (for specialist institutions, announced in [Budget 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents/budget-2020), and capital funding, [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-fires-up-rd-across-the-country-to-cement-the-uk-as-science-superpower) on 1 July 2020)
* working on Research England's contributions to the [Spending Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-launches-comprehensive-spending-review)
* preparing to chair panel sessions at the [Global Research Council conference on Responsible Research Assessment](https://web-eur.cvent.com/event/7ca86a3d-6e6f-4d11-98e9-f01fe69fdf46/summary?inviteeId=9a4a6a9d-6b8a-4671-8b10-562b26058a88) and the [Engage Festival](https://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/engage-2020).

I am thinking about, researching, or drafting articles on:

* alternatives to peer review for the allocation of research funding (mentioned in a [previous post](https://stevenhill.org.uk/a-post-pandemic-research-agenda/))
* the implications of applying the ideas of systems thinking to the research system (also mentioned in a [the same post](https://stevenhill.org.uk/a-post-pandemic-research-agenda/))
* updating the ideas in my post on ['Four trends shaping the future of research evaluation'](https://stevenhill.org.uk/four-trends-shaping-the-future-of-research-evaluation/) in the light of the pandemic
* the role of 'realist' approach to evaluation in research policy
* writing a review of [Mass Appeal](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mass-appeal-9780190062187?cc=gb&lang=en&) by Justin Gest, for the [LSE Review of Books](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/).

I am currently reading:

* [The Practice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Practice-Seth-Godin-ebook/dp/B086KV3TX5/) by Seth Godin
* [The Dark Forest](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dark-Forest-Three-Body-Problem-Book-ebook/dp/B00U7G0UYI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1604514921&sr=8-3-spons) by Cixin Liu
